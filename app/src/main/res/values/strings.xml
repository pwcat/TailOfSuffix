    <string name="notice">Notice:
        Before starting tailing(renaming files), please backup files.When the app is uninstalled, the records of tailing will be cleared, which means that it cannot reverse renaming automatically.
        Do not use any common suffix(eg: doc, png, txt, mp4,etc) as a tail, otherwise it will cause problems(this app is crude).
